**Areas to Test Manually**

############################

When testing devices manually, it's important to cover the basics of functionality primarily. A user will care far more if the device/app/site doesn't load, than if a word is slightly misaligned. These are some core areas that need to be checked.

**For opening a website/app, the following tests are most important:**

* Opening
* Closing
* Refreshing
* Zoom in
* Zoom out

**In the case of there being user input required, the following tests are most important:**

* Creating Content
* Editing Content
* Deleting Content
* Interacting with all buttons
* Scrolling all areas
* Entering all pages/sections

**In the case of media playback, the following tests are most important:**

* Opening a video
* Playing a video
* Pausing a video
* Scrubbing (the slider) the video
* Checking media autoplay (autoplay to next media content)
* Checking repeat all
* Checking shuffle
* Volume to max
* Volume to min
* Subtitles

**In the case of general device areas to check, the following tests are most important:**

* Rotating a device to check orientation
* Testing on wifi
* Testing on 3G
* Testing on 4G
* Testing on H
* Testing Voice commands
* Testing on all major browsers
* Testing bluetooth
