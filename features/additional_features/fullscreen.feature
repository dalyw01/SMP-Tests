    I want to test fullscreen functionality of SMP is working
    So that I can enter/exit fullscreen using multiple methods - double-clicking and using icons

    Given I visit "<page>" with a "<type>" player on "<device>"
    When the COOKBOOK has loaded
    And I click CTA to begin playback
    And I can pause
    And I can play
    And I can double click anywhere in the player hitbox to enter fullscreen
    And I can pause
    And I can play
    And I can double click anywhere in the player hitbox to exit fullscreen

    And I can play
    And I can seek in quarters to the end
    And I replay if "<type>"
    And I can pause
    And I can play
    And I can double click anywhere in the player hitbox to exit fullscreen
    And I can double click anywhere in the player hitbox to exit fullscreen
